        Living in Denver has its benefits, no doubt. But one of the oddities
        that results in living in high altitude is the combination of an
        inversion layer and one of the country's highest rate of growth: The
        Brown Cloud. Haven't heard of it? That's OK! It is exactly what it
        sounds like: a brown cloud that sits over the metro area of Denver. This
        project came out of feeling like "there has got to be something I can
        do". It's not a lot but if we can even help improve the results of our
        reliance on transit via automobile, it's at least one step in the right
        direction.
